My name is Martin Skilleter and I am an undergraduate student at the Australian National University. I study mathematics at the Mathematical Sciences Institute, and am preparing to enter my Honours year. My mathematical interests are more algebraic (specifically topological and geometric), but I have a wide-ranging background.
