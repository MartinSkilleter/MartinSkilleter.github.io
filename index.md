My name is Martin Skilleter and I am a student at the Australian National University, graduating in December. I recently completed a thesis under the supervision of Uri Onn and Asilata Bapat, in which I investigated Deligne-Lusztig theory and character sheaves. The thesis, as well as a short recorded talk I gave outlining the project, can be found here:
- [Deligne-Lusztig theory and character sheaves](./Deligne-Lusztig theory and character sheaves.pdf)
- [Honours project video](./Honours project video.mp4)

For a sample of my work, here are several projects I have completed under the supervision of researchers at the [Mathematical Sciences Institute](http://maths.anu.edu.au/):

- [Inner product spaces in Lean](./Inner Product Spaces in Lean.pdf)
- [Applications of persistent homology](./Applications of Persistent Homology.pdf)
- [K-Theory of C*-algebras](./K-Theory of C-star Algebras.pdf)
- [Invariants of finite groups](./Invariants of Finite Groups.pdf)

You can also find a copy of my CV [here](./Martin Skilleter - Resume.pdf).
